            HI! I&apos;m passionate about Digital Human, WebGL and rendering every pixel on canvas context. With a strong foundation in machine learning and 3D digital human modeling. My work on DeepGesture and the GENEA Leaderboard showcases end-to-end expertise, from training transformer and diffusion models on SMPL/BEAT 2 datasets to deploying production-grade evaluation systems and interactive 3D applications using Python, C++, and WebGL. I bring a combination of research depth and engineering execution to further your company&apos;s mission.

            HI! I&apos;m specialize in building practical AI and LLM solutions, combining strong engineering execution with hands-on experience in modern machine learning workflows. My background spans model training, fine-tuning, and deployment using frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and HuggingFace, as well as developing RAG systems and chatbot applications. I work comfortably across the data and ML stack - from preparing and augmenting datasets to delivering production-ready LLM pipelines on platforms like Databricks. With a foundation in transformer and diffusion models, I bring both research depth and real-world system implementation experience. My focus is on applying advanced AI to deliver measurable value in enterprise environments.
