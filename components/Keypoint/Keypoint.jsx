            HI! I&apos;m passionate about Digital Human, WebGL and rendering every pixel on canvas context. With a strong foundation in machine learning and 3D digital human modeling. My work on DeepGesture and the GENEA Leaderboard showcases end-to-end expertise, from training transformer and diffusion models on SMPL/BEAT 2 datasets to deploying production-grade evaluation systems and interactive 3D applications using Python, C++, and WebGL. I bring a combination of research depth and engineering execution to further your company&apos;s mission.
